### Things to explore
- How to calculate center of mass for complicated object
  - how to approach if not rigid?
- Can we predict dynamics of the motion
    - is there a closed form solution?
- How do things change when the pendulum motion affects the drivers motion?

### Driven rigid pendulum
*what do we know about pendulum*
- Make strong statements about forces, **torques**, energy
  - need to remind ourselves about motion
  - We want vectors for forces obviously
-What do we remember about a pendulum
    -simple harmonic motion
      - guess between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
      - $[T] = sqrt([L]/[g]), \omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi/T$
      - T is prortional to $sqrt(l/g)\
      - **Large angles break down our formula**
