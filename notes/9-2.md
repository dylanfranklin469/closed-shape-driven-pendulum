We're debating between force or energy to define the system

$F = -kx + \beta x^2 +\gamma x^3 + ...$
vs
$\inc U = (U-U_0) = ax +bx^2 + cx^3 + ...$
$bx^2 = 1/2kx^2$

If we look at the ax term, we find that (this is partial)
$F = -\delta / \delta x \incr U$
so
$F = -a$

By definition, equilibrium must be true.
